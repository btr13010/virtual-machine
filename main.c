/*
    This program is a simulator for the LC-3 (Little Computer 3) architecture. 
    It is used to simulate the way computer hardware execute the LC-3 assembly code.
    The program will be run to execute a program file written in LC-3 assembly language.

    The small memory size of LC-3 is specified, along with the registers which are 
    used to store data and addresses in the memory during the execution of the program. 
    The registers include PC (program counter) which point toward the next instruction 
    to for the CPU to execute. The opcodes and their instructions are also provided 
    for the CPU to execute the commands.

    The program is written in the C language.
